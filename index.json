We distinguish two general modes of testing for DNNs: Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application and tested in a close-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. In addition, we identify two sources for generating test datasets for DNNs: Datasets obtained from real-life and datasets generated by simulators. While offline testing can be used with datasets obtained from either sources, online testing is largely confined to using simulators since online testing within real-life applications can be time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. In this paper, we study the following two important questions aiming to compare test datasets and testing modes for DNNs: First, can we use simulator-generated data as a reliable substitute to real-world data for the purpose of DNN testing? Second, how do online and offline testing results differ and complement each other? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end control of cars' steering actuators. Our results show that simulator-generated datasets are able to yield DNN prediction errors that are similar to those obtained by testing DNNs with real-life datasets. Further, offline testing is more optimistic than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Offline and Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks: An Autonomous Car Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fitash Ul Haq","Donghwan Shin","Shiva Nejati","Lionel Briand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576956246,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576956246,"objectID":"d88aa0c6075cc4d6086ecdfcc6f1072f","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/content/publication/haq-2019-comparing/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T19:24:06.336735Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/haq-2019-comparing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Offline and Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks: An Autonomous Car Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junghun Yoo","Youlim Jung","Donghwan Shin","Minhyo Bae","Eunkyoung Jee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"5619cdab828d51227c1f085ebfff525c","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/8666514/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T17:27:44.159044Z","relpermalink":"/publication/8666514/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Blockchain;Consensus algorithm;Safety;Cryptocurrency;federated Byzantine agreement;Stellar Consensus Protocol;UPPAAL"],"title":"Formal Modeling and Verification of a Federated Byzantine Agreement Algorithm for Blockchain Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

However, diversity has received relatively little attention in mutation testing. The traditional mutation adequacy criterion is a one-dimensional measure of the total number of killed mutants. We propose a novel, diversity-aware mutation adequacy criterion called distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion, which is fully satisfied when each of the considered mutants can be identified by the set of tests that kill it, thereby encouraging inclusion of more diverse range of tests. This paper presents the formal definition of the distinguishing mutation adequacy and its score. Subsequently, an empirical study investigates the relationship among distinguishing mutation score, fault detection capability, and test suite size. The results show that the distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion detects 1.33 times more unseen faults than the traditional mutation adequacy criterion, at the cost of a 1.56 times increase in test suite size, for adequate test suites that fully satisfies the criteria. The results show a better picture for inadequate test suites; on average, 8.63 times more unseen faults are detected at the cost of a 3.14 times increase in test suite size.","tags":null,"title":"A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Diversity-Aware Mutation Adequacy Criterion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and Defects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also find that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we find that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","tags":["mutation testing","real faults","test suite effectiveness"],"title":"Are Mutation Scores Correlated with Real Fault Detection?: A Large Scale Empirical Study on the Relationship Between Mutants and Real Faults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junho Kim","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"e4b866595f2b05f318adff11b1711621","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/content/publication/kim-2017-applicability/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T19:24:06.333409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/kim-2017-applicability/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Applicability Study of Action-Benefit-Cost Model and Statistical Model Checking for System of Systems Goal Achievement Verification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junho Kim","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"15e0d659e371379891f27d1446a31b40","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/kim-2017-applicability/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T17:27:44.165162Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kim-2017-applicability/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Applicability Study of Action-Benefit-Cost Model and Statistical Model Checking for System of Systems Goal Achievement Verification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wonkyung Yun","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"c8a6eba34c9b7bd2fd6326992e12d168","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/content/publication/yun-2017-mas-3103196-3103200/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T19:24:06.328755Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/yun-2017-mas-3103196-3103200/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mutation analysis","simulation of urban mobility (SUMO)","system of systems","system of systems policy","system of systems testing"],"title":"Mutation Analysis for System of Systems Policy Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wonkyung Yun","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"795d71bc8238a42c7dcfe7308d560a66","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/yun-2017-mas-3103196-3103200/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T17:27:44.161041Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yun-2017-mas-3103196-3103200/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mutation analysis","simulation of urban mobility (SUMO)","system of systems","system of systems policy","system of systems testing"],"title":"Mutation Analysis for System of Systems Policy Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donghwan Shin","Eunkyoung Jee","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"e6b9d18e6e3f73457a807ba9dc3fb318","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/content/publication/shin-2016-comprehensive/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T19:24:06.32443Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/shin-2016-comprehensive/","section":"publication","summary":"Function block diagram (FBD), a graphical modeling language for programmable logic controllers, has been widely used to implement safety critical system software such as nuclear reactor protection systems.
