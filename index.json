The diversity-aware mutation-based technique relies on the notion of mutant distinguishment, which aims to distinguish one mutant's behaviour from another, rather than from the original program. The relative cost and effectiveness of the mutation-based prioritization techniques (i.e., using both the traditional mutant kill and the proposed mutant distinguishment) are empirically investigated with 352 real faults and 553,477 developer-written test cases. The empirical evaluation considers both the traditional and the diversity-aware mutation criteria in various settings: single-objective greedy, hybrid, and multi-objective optimization. The results show that there is no single dominant technique across all the studied faults. To this end, the reason why each one of the mutation-based prioritization criteria performs poorly is discussed, using a graphical model called Mutant Distinguishment Graph that demonstrates the distribution of the fault-detecting test cases with respect to mutant kills and distinguishment.

With the growing importance of structural testing for FBD models, structural test coverage criteria for FBD models have been proposed and evaluated using mutation analysis in our previous work. We extend the previous work by comprehensively analyzing the relationships among fault detection effectiveness, test suite size, and coverage level through several research questions. We generate a large number of test suites achieving an FBD test coverage ranging from 0 to 100 %, and we also generate many artificial faults (i.e. mutants) for the FBD models. Our analysis results show that the fault detection effectiveness of the FBD coverage criteria increases with increasing coverage levels, and the coverage criteria are highly effective at detecting faults in all subject models. Furthermore, the test suites generated with the FBD coverage criteria are more effective and efficient than the randomly generated test suites. The FBD coverage criteria are strong at detecting faults in Boolean edges, while relatively weak at detecting wrong constants in FBD models. Empirical knowledge regarding our experiments provide the validity of using the FBD coverage criteria, and therefore, of FBD model-based testing.","tags":null,"title":"Comprehensive analysis of FBD test coverage criteria using mutants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

Even if the same developers work on the same project, the time span of the project and the quality of software may change based on the project plan. When software managers plan a software project, they strive to allocate human resources in a more efficient way to produce a better software with less cost. The planning process is, however, time-consuming and complicated, especially when the size of the software project is large. Many approaches have been proposed to help software project managers by providing optimal human resource allocations in terms of minimizing the cost. Previous approaches, however, only concentrated on minimizing the cost, and no existing works have considered the practical issues affecting project schedules in practice. We elicited the practical considerations relating to the human resource allocation problem through discussions with a group of software project experts. The practical considerations can affect the project schedule in practice, but their importance has not been taken into consideration in previous approaches. Reflecting the practical considerations, we propose an approach for solving the human resource allocation problem using a genetic algorithm (GA). We compare our approach to an approach that only considers minimization of the time span. Our evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm considers the practical considerations well, in terms of continuous allocation on relevant tasks, minimization of developer multitasking time, and balance of allocation. We also conducted a survey targeting software developers and managers, and the responses showed that practical considerations are as important as minimizing the cost, and our approach would be helpful to software managers. We also investigate the effect of weight factors and coefficient between sub-scores, and find that it is difficult to consider some practical considerations at the same time.","tags":null,"title":"Human Resource Allocation in Software Project with Practical Considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongwon Seo","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"4597621fe9c5baf6474f92639163d9f2","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/seo-2015-quality/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T14:18:51.365051Z","relpermalink":"/publication/seo-2015-quality/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quality Based Software Project Staffing and Scheduling with Budget and Deadline.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eunkyoung Jee","Donghwan Shin","Sungdeok Cha","Jang-Soo Lee","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"6f6e65f7a3fa201ca1bf548c5ade8c5b","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/doi-10-1002-stvr-1548/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T14:18:51.35822Z","relpermalink":"/publication/doi-10-1002-stvr-1548/","section":"publication","summary":"Automated and effective testing for function block diagram (FBD) programs has become an important issue, as FBD is increasingly used in implementing safety-critical systems. This work describes an automated test case generation technique for FBD programs and its associated toolâFBDTester. Given an FBD program and desired test coverage criteria, FBDTester generates test requirements and invokes the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver iteratively to derive a set of test cases. An industrial case study using reactor protection system software shows that the automatically generated test suites detected at least 82% of the known faults, whereas manually generated test cases only detected approximately 35%. Mutation analysis revealed that the automatically generated test suites substantially outperformed manually generated ones. Although test sequence generation requires some manual effort in the current FBDTester, it is apparent that the proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency and the reliability of FBD testing.
