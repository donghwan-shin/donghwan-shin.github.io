As a recommended practice of the Verification and Validation (V\u0026V) process of ISO/PAS 21448, a candidate standard for safety of the intended functionality for road vehicles, simulation-based testing has the potential to reduce both risks and costs. There is a growing body of research on devising test automation techniques using simulators for Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). However, how similar are the results if the same test scenarios are executed in different simulators? We conduct a replication study of applying a Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) solution to a real-world ADAS (PeVi, a pedestrian vision detection system) using two different commercial simulators, namely, TASS/Siemens PreScan and ESI Pro-SiVIC. Based on a minimalistic scene, we compare critical test scenarios generated using our SBST solution in these two simulators. We show that SBST can be used to effectively and efficiently generate critical test scenarios in both simulators, and the test results obtained from the two simulators can reveal several weaknesses of the ADAS under test. However, executing the same test scenarios in the two simulators leads to notable differences in the details of the test outputs, in particular, related to (1) safety violations revealed by tests, and (2) dynamics of cars and pedestrians. Based on our findings, we recommend future V\u0026V plans to include multiple simulators to support robust simulation-based testing and to base test objectives on measures that are less dependant on the internals of the simulators.","tags":[],"title":"Digital Twins Are Not Monozygotic -- Cross-Replicating ADAS Testing in Two Industry-Grade Automotive Simulators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fitash Ul Haq","Donghwan Shin","Lionel Briand","Thomas Stifter","Jun Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615396733,"objectID":"9c15338e965a95721cbad90b2a5dc431","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/arxiv-2021-kpdnn/","publishdate":"2021-03-10T17:18:53.176861Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv-2021-kpdnn/","section":"publication","summary":"Automatically detecting the positions of key-points (e.g., facial key-points or finger key-points) in an image is an essential problem in many applications, such as driver's gaze detection and drowsiness detection in automated driving systems. With the recent advances of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Key-Points detection DNNs (KP-DNNs) have been increasingly employed for that purpose. Nevertheless, KP-DNN testing and validation have remained a challenging problem because KP-DNNs predict many independent key-points at the same time -- where each individual key-point may be critical in the targeted application -- and images can vary a great deal according to many factors. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate test data for KP-DNNs using many-objective search. In our experiments, focused on facial key-points detection DNNs developed for an industrial automotive application, we show that our approach can generate test suites to severely mispredict, on average, more than 93% of all key-points. In comparison, random search-based test data generation can only severely mispredict 41% of them. Many of these mispredictions, however, are not avoidable and should not therefore be considered failures. We also empirically compare state-of-the-art, many-objective search algorithms and their variants, tailored for test suite generation. Furthermore, we investigate and demonstrate how to learn specific conditions, based on image characteristics (e.g., head posture and skin color), that lead to severe mispredictions. Such conditions serve as a basis for risk analysis or DNN retraining.","tags":[],"title":"Automatic Test Suite Generation for Key-points Detection DNNs Using Many-Objective Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fitash Ul Haq","Donghwan Shin","Shiva Nejati","Lionel Briand"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"f578c67d37087a04971a4de72b709c6c","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/icst-2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.436956Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icst-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a growing body of research on developing testing techniques for Deep Neural Networks (DNN). We distinguish two general modes of testing for DNNs: Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application and tested in a close-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. In addition, we identify two sources for generating test datasets for DNNs: Datasets obtained from real-life and datasets generated by simulators. While offline testing can be used with datasets obtained from either sources, online testing is largely confined to using simulators since online testing within real-life applications can be time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. In this paper, we study the following two important questions aiming to compare test datasets and testing modes for DNNs: First, can we use simulator-generated data as a reliable substitute to real-world data for the purpose of DNN testing? Second, how do online and offline testing results differ and complement each other? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end control of carsâ€™ steering actuators. Our results show that simulator-generated datasets are able to yield DNN prediction errors that are similar to those obtained by testing DNNs with real-life datasets. Further, offline testing is more optimistic than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Offline and Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks: An Autonomous Car Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donghwan Shin","Domenico Bianculli","Lionel Briand"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615396733,"objectID":"b523e45ad291bfd5d9dad09ff0c0606b","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/arxiv-2020-logcleaner/","publishdate":"2021-03-10T17:18:53.322855Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arxiv-2020-logcleaner/","section":"publication","summary":"Model inference aims to extract accurate models from the execution logs of software systems. However, in reality, logs may contain some \"noise\" that could deteriorate the performance of model inference. One form of noise can commonly be found in system logs that contain not only transactional messages---logging the functional behavior of the system---but also operational messages---recording the operational state of the system (e.g., a periodic heartbeat to keep track of the memory usage). In low-quality logs, transactional and operational messages are randomly interleaved, leading to the erroneous inclusion of operational behaviors into a system model, that ideally should only reflect the functional behavior of the system. It is therefore important to remove operational messages in the logs before inferring models. In this paper, we propose LogCleaner, a novel technique for removing operational logs messages. LogCleaner first performs a periodicity analysis to filter out periodic messages, and then it performs a dependency analysis to calculate the degree of dependency for all log messages and to remove operational messages based on their dependencies. The experimental results on two proprietary and 11 publicly available log datasets show that LogCleaner, on average, can accurately remove 98% of the operational messages and preserve 81% of the transactional messages. Furthermore, using logs pre-processed with LogCleaner decreases the execution time of model inference (with a speed-up ranging from 1.5 to 946.7 depending on the characteristics of the system) and significantly improves the accuracy of the inferred models, by increasing their ability to accept correct system behaviors (+43.8 pp on average, with pp=percentage points) and to reject incorrect system behaviors (+15.0 pp on average).","tags":[],"title":"Effective Removal of Operational Log Messages: an Application to Model Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junghun Yoo","Youlim Jung","Donghwan Shin","Minhyo Bae","Eunkyoung Jee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"55ededb85012d3d9512b9c73dc050356","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/iwbose-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.43026Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iwbose-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Blockchain;Consensus algorithm;Safety;Cryptocurrency;federated Byzantine agreement;Stellar Consensus Protocol;UPPAAL"],"title":"Formal Modeling and Verification of a Federated Byzantine Agreement Algorithm for Blockchain Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donghwan Shin","Shin Yoo","Mike Papadakis","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7d2618d8b44c5f9e68e0dc5bf101a635","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/stvr-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.428618Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stvr-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we propose a new test case prioritization technique that combines both mutation-based and diversity-aware approaches. The diversity-aware mutation-based technique relies on the notion of mutant distinguishment, which aims to distinguish one mutant's behaviour from another, rather than from the original program. The relative cost and effectiveness of the mutation-based prioritization techniques (i.e., using both the traditional mutant kill and the proposed mutant distinguishment) are empirically investigated with 352 real faults and 553,477 developer-written test cases. The empirical evaluation considers both the traditional and the diversity-aware mutation criteria in various settings: single-objective greedy, hybrid, and multi-objective optimization. The results show that there is no single dominant technique across all the studied faults. To this end, the reason why each one of the mutation-based prioritization criteria performs poorly is discussed, using a graphical model called Mutant Distinguishment Graph that demonstrates the distribution of the fault-detecting test cases with respect to mutant kills and distinguishment.

However, diversity has received relatively little attention in mutation testing. The traditional mutation adequacy criterion is a one-dimensional measure of the total number of killed mutants. We propose a novel, diversity-aware mutation adequacy criterion called distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion, which is fully satisfied when each of the considered mutants can be identified by the set of tests that kill it, thereby encouraging inclusion of more diverse range of tests. This paper presents the formal definition of the distinguishing mutation adequacy and its score. Subsequently, an empirical study investigates the relationship among distinguishing mutation score, fault detection capability, and test suite size. The results show that the distinguishing mutation adequacy criterion detects 1.33 times more unseen faults than the traditional mutation adequacy criterion, at the cost of a 1.56 times increase in test suite size, for adequate test suites that fully satisfies the criteria. The results show a better picture for inadequate test suites; on average, 8.63 times more unseen faults are detected at the cost of a 3.14 times increase in test suite size.","tags":null,"title":"A Theoretical and Empirical Study of Diversity-Aware Mutation Adequacy Criterion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingyu Jin","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"350447874f325d919cb4662502f01e2a","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/sac-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.431114Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sac-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["action-benefit-cost modeling","agent-based modeling","decision-making","interaction","system of systems"],"title":"ABC+: Extended Action-benefit-cost Modeling with Knowledge-based Decision-making and Interaction Model for System of Systems Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mike Papadakis","Donghwan Shin","Shin Yoo","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"7f812332e2568511995fc83ff9d61ae6","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/icse-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.430703Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icse-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Empirical validation of software testing studies is increasingly relying on mutants. This practice is motivated by the strong correlation between mutant scores and real fault detection that is reported in the literature. In contrast, our study shows that correlations are the results of the confounding effects of the test suite size. In particular, we investigate the relation between two independent variables, mutation score and test suite size, with one dependent variable the detection of (real) faults. We use two data sets, CoreBench and Defects4J, with large C and Java programs and real faults and provide evidence that all correlations between mutation scores and real fault detection are weak when controlling for test suite size. We also find that both independent variables significantly influence the dependent one, with significantly better fits, but overall with relative low prediction power. By measuring the fault detection capability of the top ranked, according to mutation score, test suites (opposed to randomly selected test suites of the same size), we find that achieving higher mutation scores improves significantly the fault detection. Taken together, our data suggest that mutants provide good guidance for improving the fault detection of test suites, but their correlation with fault detection are weak.","tags":["mutation testing","real faults","test suite effectiveness"],"title":"Are Mutation Scores Correlated with Real Fault Detection?: A Large Scale Empirical Study on the Relationship Between Mutants and Real Faults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junho Kim","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"3d0a13636c224864a9627a5a82d6ae28","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/kiise-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.434331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kiise-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Applicability Study of Action-Benefit-Cost Model and Statistical Model Checking for System of Systems Goal Achievement Verification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wonkyung Yun","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"658e1a081d0b6705d9564a390d979e41","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/jsos-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.431512Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jsos-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mutation analysis","simulation of urban mobility (SUMO)","system of systems","system of systems policy","system of systems testing"],"title":"Mutation Analysis for System of Systems Policy Testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donghwan Shin","Eunkyoung Jee","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"90a69de384b61f2fee3e7f84b2d32d0c","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/sosym-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.429037Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sosym-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Function block diagram (FBD), a graphical modeling language for programmable logic controllers, has been widely used to implement safety critical system software such as nuclear reactor protection systems.

We extend the previous work by comprehensively analyzing the relationships among fault detection effectiveness, test suite size, and coverage level through several research questions. We generate a large number of test suites achieving an FBD test coverage ranging from 0 to 100 %, and we also generate many artificial faults (i.e. mutants) for the FBD models. Our analysis results show that the fault detection effectiveness of the FBD coverage criteria increases with increasing coverage levels, and the coverage criteria are highly effective at detecting faults in all subject models. Furthermore, the test suites generated with the FBD coverage criteria are more effective and efficient than the randomly generated test suites. The FBD coverage criteria are strong at detecting faults in Boolean edges, while relatively weak at detecting wrong constants in FBD models.

Even if the same developers work on the same project, the time span of the project and the quality of software may change based on the project plan. When software managers plan a software project, they strive to allocate human resources in a more efficient way to produce a better software with less cost. The planning process is, however, time-consuming and complicated, especially when the size of the software project is large. Many approaches have been proposed to help software project managers by providing optimal human resource allocations in terms of minimizing the cost. Previous approaches, however, only concentrated on minimizing the cost, and no existing works have considered the practical issues affecting project schedules in practice. We elicited the practical considerations relating to the human resource allocation problem through discussions with a group of software project experts. The practical considerations can affect the project schedule in practice, but their importance has not been taken into consideration in previous approaches. Reflecting the practical considerations, we propose an approach for solving the human resource allocation problem using a genetic algorithm (GA). We compare our approach to an approach that only considers minimization of the time span. Our evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm considers the practical considerations well, in terms of continuous allocation on relevant tasks, minimization of developer multitasking time, and balance of allocation. We also conducted a survey targeting software developers and managers, and the responses showed that practical considerations are as important as minimizing the cost, and our approach would be helpful to software managers. We also investigate the effect of weight factors and coefficient between sub-scores, and find that it is difficult to consider some practical considerations at the same time.","tags":null,"title":"Human Resource Allocation in Software Project with Practical Considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongwon Seo","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"7467eea63d193ea570e713ed56091094","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/apsec-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.432762Z","relpermalink":"/publication/apsec-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quality Based Software Project Staffing and Scheduling with Budget and Deadline.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongwon Seo","Donghwan Shin","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"87b1f0ad5851c60fcb45181bac9a430a","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/kiise-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.435081Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kiise-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Quality-based software project staffing and scheduling with project deadline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eunkyoung Jee","Donghwan Shin","Sungdeok Cha","Jang-Soo Lee","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"9de5a0ebf41343a07a83faee91a3158a","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/stvr-2014/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.428189Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stvr-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"Automated and effective testing for function block diagram (FBD) programs has become an important issue, as FBD is increasingly used in implementing safety-critical systems. This work describes an automated test case generation technique for FBD programs and its associated toolâ€”FBDTester. Given an FBD program and desired test coverage criteria, FBDTester generates test requirements and invokes the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver iteratively to derive a set of test cases. An industrial case study using reactor protection system software shows that the automatically generated test suites detected at least 82% of the known faults, whereas manually generated test cases only detected approximately 35%. Mutation analysis revealed that the automatically generated test suites substantially outperformed manually generated ones. Although test sequence generation requires some manual effort in the current FBDTester, it is apparent that the proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency and the reliability of FBD testing.

With increased importance of structural testing for FBD models, FBD model-based test coverage criteria have been introduced. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the fault detection effectiveness of the FBD coverage criteria using mutation analysis. We produce 1800 test suites satisfying the FBD criteria and generate more than 600 mutants automatically for the target industrial FBD models. Then we evaluate mutant detection of the test suites to assess the fault detection effectiveness of the coverage criteria. Based on the experimental results, we analyze strengths and weaknesses of the FBD coverage criteria, and suggest possible improvements for the test coverage criteria.","tags":null,"title":"Empirical Evaluation on FBD Model-Based Test Coverage Criteria Using Mutation Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yeong-Seok Seo","Donghwan Shin","Gookhyun Kim","Jongmoon Baik","Doo-Hwan Bae"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376e3,"objectID":"f5dcf5d0d913e71dfe01298e9533fede","permalink":"https://donghwan-shin.github.io/publication/ijpe-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-05T10:34:39.42988Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijpe-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Identification of Quality Improvement Strategies using COPQ in Software Industry","type":"publication"}]
